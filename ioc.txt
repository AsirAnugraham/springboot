The Spring framework can be considered as a collection of sub-frameworks, also referred to as layers, such as Spring AOP, Spring ORM, Spring Web Flow, and Spring Web MVC. 
*You can use any of these modules separately while constructing a Web application. 
*The modules may also be grouped together to provide better functionalities in a web application. 

Prior to penetrating down to Spring to container do remember that Spring provides two types of Containers namely as follows:

BeanFactory Container

ApplicationContext Container

The features of the Spring framework such as IoC, AOP, and transaction management, make it unique among the list of frameworks. Some of the most important features of the Spring framework are as follows:

IoC container

Data Access Framework

Spring MVC

Transaction Management

Spring Web Services

JDBC abstraction layer

Spring TestContext framework

Spring IoC Container is the core of Spring Framework. 
*It creates the objects, configures and assembles their dependencies, manages their entire life cycle. 
*The Container uses Dependency Injection(DI) to manage the components that make up the application. 
*It gets the information about the objects from a configuration file(XML) or Java Code or Java Annotations and Java POJO class. 
*These objects are called Beans. Since the Controlling of Java objects and their lifecycle is not done by the developers, hence the name Inversion Of Control]
