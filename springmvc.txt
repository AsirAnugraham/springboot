-A Spring MVC is a Java framework which is used to build web applications.
-It follows the Model-View-Controller design pattern. 
-It implements all the basic features of a core spring framework like Inversion of Control, Dependency Injection.

-A Spring MVC provides an elegant solution to use MVC in spring framework by the help of DispatcherServlet.
-Here, DispatcherServlet is a class that receives the incoming request and maps it to the right resource such as controllers, models, and views.


Advantages of Spring MVC Framework

Separate roles - The Spring MVC separates each role, where the model object, controller, command object, view resolver, DispatcherServlet, validator, etc. can be fulfilled by a specialized object.

Light-weight - It uses light-weight servlet container to develop and deploy your application.

Powerful Configuration - It provides a robust configuration for both framework and application classes that includes easy referencing across contexts, such as from web controllers to business objects and validators.

Rapid development - The Spring MVC facilitates fast and parallel development.

Reusable business code - Instead of creating new objects, it allows us to use the existing business objects.

Easy to test - In Spring, generally we create JavaBeans classes that enable you to inject test data using the setter methods.

Flexible Mapping - It provides the specific annotations that easily redirect the page.


MVC( Model and View Controller

What is view controller model?
-The Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. 
-Each of these components are built to handle specific development aspects of an application.

What is MVC and why it is used?

- MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a pattern in software design commonly used to implement user interfaces, data, and controlling logic.
- It emphasizes a separation between the software's business logic and display.
- This "separation of concerns" provides for a better division of labor and improved maintenance.
