DEPENDENCY INJECTION

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that removes the dependency from the programming code so that it can be easy to manage and test the application. 
 -Dependency Injection makes our programming code loosely coupled.

There are mainly two problems of dependency lookup.

-Tight coupling The dependency lookup approach makes the code tightly coupled.If resource is changed, we need to perform a lot of modification in the code.

-Not easy for testing This approach creates a lot of problems while testing the application especially in black box testing.

Spring framework provides two ways to inject dependency

-By Constructor
-By Setter method
