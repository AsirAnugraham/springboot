Spring Initializr is a web-based tool provided by the Pivotal Web Service.
 -With the help of Spring Initializr, we can easily generate the structure of the Spring Boot Project. 
 -It offers extensible API for creating JVM-based projects.

It also provides various options for the project that are expressed in a metadata model.
-The metadata model allows us to configure the list of dependencies supported by JVM and platform versions, etc. 
-It serves its metadata in a well-known that provides necessary assistance to third-party clients.

Spring Initializr Modules.

Spring Initializr has the following module:

initializr-actuator: It provides additional information and statistics on project generation. It is an optional module.

initializr-bom: In this module, BOM stands for Bill Of Materials. In Spring Boot, BOM is a special kind of POM that is used to control the versions of a project's dependencies. It provides a central place to define and update those versions. It provides flexibility to add a dependency in our module without worrying about the versions.

Outside the software world, the BOM is a list of parts, items, assemblies, and other materials required to create products. It explains what, how, and where to collect required materials.

initializr-docs: It provides documentation.

initializr-generator: It is a core project generation library.

initializr-generator-spring:

initializr-generator-test: It provides a test infrastructure for project generation.

initializr-metadata: It provides metadata infrastructure for various aspects of the projects.

initializr-service-example: It provides custom instances.

initializr-version-resolver: It is an optional module to extract version numbers from an arbitrary POM.

initializr-web: It provides web endpoints for third party clients.



Generating a Project

Before creating a project, we must be friendly with UI.
 -Spring Initializr UI has the following labels:

Project: It defines the kind of project. 
-We can create either Maven Project or Gradle Project. 
-We will create a Maven Project throughout the tutorial.

Language: Spring Initializr provides the choice among three languages Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. 
-Java is by default selected.

Spring Boot: We can select the Spring Boot version. The latest version is 2.2.2.

Project Metadata: It contains information related to the project, such as Group, Artifact, etc. 
-Group denotes the package name; Artifact denotes the Application name. 
-The default Group name is com.example, and the default Artifact name is demo.

Dependencies: Dependencies are the collection of artifacts that we can add to our project.
